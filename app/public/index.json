But a little content or progress was publish in it. This decision was to enable me to focus more on content creation and DevOps related projects/learnings.\nWhy Django? It has been a journey, everything was built from scratch, from html/js/cs to integrating it to the web framework and building it into container. Django wasn\u0026rsquo;t my first web framework that I used, I created my first API using Flask. But I have always been a sucker for more complicated things/technology; hence Django.\nBuilding my first website/blog on Django is a bit overkill. But this has been my gateway to Web-development to Linux Administration and now being DevOps.\nThe old website will still be up and running as I intend to keep the development active.\nWhy Hugo? I needed to migrate the site to something that is lower in maintenance and can easily generate template or pages for my blog/post. Since this translate Markdown language to HTML, I can focus less on thinkering on the codes.\nHugo is a Fast \u0026amp; Modern Static Website Engine. It\u0026rsquo;s built on top of Go, this would enable me to learn Go or maybe PHP üòÅ.\nIf you are interested in trying Hugo, please visit this site to get started. It has a good documentation it even covered migration from different provider or from other static site generator.\n","permalink":"https://tagsdev.click/post/sige-migrate-django-hugo/","summary":"Back in 2021, I\u0026rsquo;ve deployed my first website mark.tagsdev.click running on Django as its web framework.
