# Moon Landing - A Space Exploration

Found this on my git archived; this was supposed to be (metaphorically) our space exploration to the mysteries of the Moon to the endless expanse of the galaxy. Our journey to uncover lunar secrets and seeks answer to the universe's greatest questions (ours). 

But we couldn't find hope in fatalism. If the future is predetermined, then the here and now becomes all the more precious. Embracing the beauty and significance of what we hold, we could had found hope even in the midst of uncertainty. You don't choose to live or love someone because it assured things will work out in the end, but because the alternate is, well returning to nothing.

Let this serve as a timeless reminder; amidst what happened, the moon's beauty endures as do you and our memories.
