**After Ride Thoughts:** Just for the clout (kidding). My first ever event and it is not a race. Just happy to have finished it and a good change in scenery. Subic was a pretty place to go for a bike ride, I would have love to go for more ride with no time constrain just you with the nature and your traumas creeping through your mind hahaha. 

**To ride it again?:** Yes, if for higher category.
