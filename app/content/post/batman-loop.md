**Route:** <a href="/route/batman_loop.gpx" download="batman_loop.gpx"> batman_loop.gpx </a>

**Distance:** 254Km

**Elevation Gain:** 3750m

**Ride ID:** [link](https://www.strava.com/activities/13735804494) 

**After Ride Thoughts:** Slept almost a day just to recover. Had a lot of fun, first ever ride with [Padayon Cycling Club](https://www.facebook.com/search/top?q=padayon%20and%20friends) Bede, Keon, Karl and Marc. I underestimate Sierra Madre going to the mountains of Infanta, Quezon,  since I already have a lot of experience climbing Sierra Madre. Well I am to blame since I didn't check the total elevation gain of the route and also mid ride, the group decided to change route from just Infanta Arch (90KM) to making it into a loop. The pain and suffering was worth-it, the scenery was enough for me to keep going (don't know about the group though, but I just know we felt the same hahaha, cyclist are a bunch of M :) ). 

**To ride it again?:** If reverse, why not!
