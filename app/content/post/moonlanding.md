# Moon Landing

Found this on my git archived; this was supposed to be (metaphorically) our space exploration to the mysteries of the Moon to the endless expanse of the galaxy. Our journey to uncover lunar secrets and seeks answer to the universe's greatest questions (ours). 

But we didn't find hope in fatalism, you don't choose to live or love someone because it assured things will work out in the end, but because the alternate is, well returning to nothing.

Let this serve as a timeless reminder; amidst what happened, the moon's beauty endures as do you and our memories.
